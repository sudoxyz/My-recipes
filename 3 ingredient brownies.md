***My 3 ingredients Choco brownie***

***3 bananas*** - make sure they are proper ripe, if they look kind of brown and sad, that's perfect. They are really sweet, and the right texture for these brownies

***125g peanut butter*** -either smooth or crunchy, it doesn't matter much. This can be replaced with almond butter or any other nut butter of your choice

***45g cocoa powder***- your regular baking cocoa powder would do

Add some peanuts on top if you are feeling nutty

Just mix them all together (like a lot)
Stick in the oven for 15 mins at 170c

Vegan btw
