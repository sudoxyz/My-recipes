***My vegan mug brownie***

----------------------------------------------------------------------

***Sweetener*** - For sugariness (makes sense)

***Sea salt*** - it really enhances the sweetness

***Flour*** - I used regular all-purpose flour, but you could try it with gluten-free flour or another kind if you want.

***Vanilla extract*** - for even more sweetness

***Choco chips*** - These are optional, but chocolate chip brownies are so good!

***Cocoa powder*** - To give this brownie its chocolate flavour

***Water*** - Cold, warm, room temperature, it doesn’t really matter

***Oil*** - to bind

------------------------------------------------------------------

***Method***

**Combine All Ingredients** - Using a fork, mix flour, brown sugar, oil, cocoa powder, water, vanilla extract, chocolate chips, and salt in a mug

**Put Mixture in the Microwave** - Into the microwave you go! Say a little prayer that it doesn’t explode everywhere. (I put mine on 60 seconds – it was perfect.) Then dig in!
